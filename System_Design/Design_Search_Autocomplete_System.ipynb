    "Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#').\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string array sentences and an integer array times both of length n where sentences[i] is a previously typed sentence and times[i] is the corresponding number of times the sentence was typed. For each input character except '#', return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have the same prefix as the part of the sentence already typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the specific rules:\n",
    "- The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.\n",
    "- The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same hot degree, use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).\n",
    "- If less than 3 hot sentences exist, return as many as you can.\n",
    "- When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the AutocompleteSystem class:\n",
    "- AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times) Initializes the object with the sentences and times arrays.\n",
    "- List<String> input(char c) This indicates that the user typed the character c.\n",
    "    - Returns an empty array [] if c == '#' and stores the inputted sentence in the system.\n",
    "    - Returns the top 3 historical hot sentences that have the same prefix as the part of the sentence already typed. If there are fewer than 3 matches, return them all."
